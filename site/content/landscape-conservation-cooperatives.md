Today's conservation challenges are increasingly complex. Widespread threats such as drought, climate change and large-scale habitat fragmentation don't just impact isolated places or individual species, but entire landscapes and multiple resources simultaneously.

These challenges are too large for the Service or any single organization to meet alone. Realizing it will take a combined effort involving many public and private organizations to deal with such landscape-scale issues, DOI in 2010 launched a network of partnerships known as Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCCs) to bring people and resources together for strategic advantage. These LCCS provide a forum for private, nonprofit, local, state, federal, tribal organizations and other groups to strategically apply their individual resources and expertise to ensure the sustainability of our economy, land, water, wildlife, and cultural resources.

There are 22 such public-private partnerships in the LCC national network, with more than 270 participating organizations collaborating in identifying common priorities at the large landscape level, investing in the science needed to make smart conservation decisions, and then working together to meet shared goals. The Gulf Coast Region is included within four LCCs: Gulf Coast Prairie; Gulf Coastal Plains and Ozarks; South Atlantic; and Peninsular Florida.

These LCCs address Gulf Coast ecosystem restoration and conservation issues and have established a Gulf Coast Landscape Conservation Liaison as a shared position between the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and NOAA. The liaison position supports collaboration, and facilitates a coordinated approach to conservation between the four LCCs.
