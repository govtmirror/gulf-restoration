The Service is the principal agency through which the federal government carries out its responsibilities to conserve, protect, and enhance the nation's fish and wildlife and their habitats for the continuing benefit of the American people.

The Service’s efforts over the last 90+ years to protect wildlife and their habitats have resulted in a network of protected areas that form the [National Wildlife Refuge System](http://www.fws.gov/refuges/?ref=topbar). This network of protected areas is the largest and most diverse in the world. Its lands provide essential habitat for numerous wildlife species, numbers of recreational opportunities for the public, and a variety of benefits to local communities.

The Service’s refuge stewardship responsibilities began in the Gulf states in 1903 with the establishment of Pelican Island National Wildlife Refuge, and on the Gulf Coast itself in 1904 with that of Breton Island National Wildlife Refuge. The Service presently manages millions of acres on 45 national wildlife refuges in the Gulf Coast states. These refuges range in size from xxx (name) to xxx (name).
