# Our Gulf Restoration Program

The Gulf Program is a multi-disciplinary team of Service professionals who are working together to develop the Service’s capacity to strategically connect with programs and partners throughout the Gulf of Mexico and its watershed. The team’s mission is to collaborate in leveraging Gulf restoration efforts to maximize conservation outcomes.

## Program Elements

The team is comprised of staff in in programs across the Service’s five geographic regions that encompass the Gulf of Mexico watershed: Southeast; Southwest; Midwest; Northeast and Mountain-Prairie. While members are physically located in offices as far apart as Rock Island, Illinois, and Panama City, Florida, the team is not focused geographically but is organized into five functional areas:

- Habitat Conservation
- Restoration
- Science
- Environmental Compliance
- Communications

The Program involves support from Service staff such as environmental compliance experts, restoration biologists, geographic information system (GIS) analysts, administrative officers, database managers, realty assistants and communication specialists.

## The Origin of the Program

The Gulf of Mexico is critically important to the health and vitality of our nation’s economic and natural resources. The Gulf and its Coast, from Texas to Florida, is home to more than 130 federally protected species, most of which are endangered.
The explosion of the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) rig here on April 20, 2010, set into motion one of the largest environmental disasters in our nation’s history. The Service, recognizing both the severity of the spill as well as the long-standing ecological challenges facing the region, established the Program in February 2014. The team is focused on the recovery of the region from this 2010 disaster, as well as broader ecosystem challenges brought on by storms, development pressures and other stressors.

In the aftermath of the *DWH* oil spill, a number of new restoration initiatives began. Each has the potential to direct billions of dollars into restoration projects.

## The Work of the Program

The core goal of the Program is to create a unified, strategic approach to Gulf restoration. The initial approach rests on a conceptual, long-term restoration plan released by the Service in 2013 entitled [“Vision for a Healthy Gulf of Mexico Watershed.” (PDF)](www.fws.gov/gulfrestoration/pdf/VisionDocument.pdf) The Service’s 2016 **“Next Steps for a Healthy Gulf of Mexico Watershed”** highlights detailed courses of action for the development and implementation of conservation and restoration initiatives following the principles put forth in the earlier document.
