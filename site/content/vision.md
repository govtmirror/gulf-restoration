The Service is uniquely positioned to be a strong partner in the restoration of the Gulf of Mexico and its watershed. Our mission — to conserve, protect and enhance fish, wildlife, plants and their habitats for the continuing benefit of the American people — compels us to address the Gulf of Mexico's most convoluted challenges. It is also our obligation because the Service is:

- the steward of America's national wildlife refuges, which make up the backbone of a network of conservation lands dedicated to supporting fish and wildlife populations. The Service manages 233 national wildlife refuges in the Gulf of Mexico watershed, with millions of acres on 45 refuges along the Gulf coast alone.
- the lead federal agency for the protection of migratory birds and anadromous fish, i.e., fish such as the salmon that migrate up rivers from the sea to spawn.
- the agency that co-leads federal efforts for the recovery of federally threatened and endangered species, dedicated to working with states and others to proactively conserve species in the hope they will not require federal protection.

The Gulf of Mexico watershed crosses five of the Service's eight geographic regions (Southeast, Southwest, Midwest, Mountain-Prairie, and Northeast).  As a result, the Service has field and regional representation in all 31 states in the watershed that provide conservation planning and programs such as wildlife and sport fish restoration grants, endangered species recovery work, environmental contaminants response, and law enforcement, among others.

# Our Vision

The Service understands that conserving, protecting and enhancing natural habitats not only benefits fish and wildlife – it benefits our society as a whole. The need for fresh water, storm protection, flood attenuation, climate change adaptation/mitigation, environmental education, outdoor recreation (e.g., hunting, fishing), and other natural services are shared across communities. These ecosystem services support healthy and resilient communities and economies, and are essential for long-term resiliency.

The Service's Vision for a Healthy Gulf of Mexico Watershed ([full document](http://www.fws.gov/gulfrestoration/pdf/VisionDocument.pdf), PDF, 7.8 MB - [summary overview](http://www.fws.gov/gulfrestoration/pdf/one-pagevisiondocument.pdf), PDF, 1.8 MB) identifies eight conservation strategies (the how we want to work with our partners) and 16 conservation focal areas (the where we want to work with our partners).

The conservation strategies are to:

- Use sound science;
- Restore resources impacted by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill;
- Create a network of protected lands;
- Restore wetland and aquatic ecosystems;
- Conserve prairies and forests;
- Protect and restore coastal strand, barrier island and estuarine island habitats;
- Conserve working lands; and
- Manage lands and waters for sustainable populations of fish and wildlife.

The conservation focal areas, from west to east, are: Laguna Madre and Lower Rio Grande River Valley; Texas Coastal Bend; Austin's Woods and Prairies; Chenier Plain; Mississippi River Delta, Coastal Wetlands and Barrier Islands; Atchafalaya River Basin; Mississippi Alluvial Valley; Northern Gulf Coast; Alabama and Florida Panhandle Beaches; Florida Panhandle; Apalachicola River Watershed; Big Bend Springs Conservation; Southwest Florida; Upper Mississippi River Watershed; Rainwater Basin; and Prairie Pothole Region.
