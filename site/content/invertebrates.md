# Invertebrates

The Service is responsible, along with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, for implementing provisions of the Federal Endangered Species Act.  This means the Service manages the conservation of invertebrate species that are threatened or endangered in the Gulf region, as well as the conservation of the habitat upon which these spineless creatures depend.

Invertebrate species found in the Gulf of Mexico region over which the Service has jurisdiction include:

## Miami Tiger Beetle

The Miami tiger beetle (*Cicindela floridana*) is one  of the smallest tiger beetles in the United States, measuring 0.26-0.35 inches long. It can be identified by its unique shiny dark green dorsal surface. As is typical of other tiger beetles, adult Miami tiger beetles are active daytime predators. They use their keen vision to detect movement of prey, and then run quickly to capture it with their well-developed jaws.

The Miami tiger beetles is found exclusively in pine rocklands. This ecosystem is unique to southern Florida and the Bahamas. In Florida, pine rocklands are found along the Miami Rock Ridge, within the Florida Keys, and in Big Cypress National Preserve. The Service has determined that the beetle is currently at risk of extinction throughout all of its range and proposed to list the species as endangered on December 22, 2015.

## Schaus Swallowtail

The Schaus swallowtail (*Papilio aristodemus ponceanus*) has black-brown wings with yellow markings and a broad rusty patch underneath the hind wing. One of the things that make this butterfly unique is its ability to stop suddenly in mid-air and fly backwards to avoid its predators. Adult individuals have a lifespan of only one month.

The Schaus swallowtail was first listed as threatened and then was reclassified as endangered in 1984. Hurricane Andrew nearly blew it into extinction in 1992, leaving only 73 individuals alive. Captive-breeding programs are helping to restore the Schaus swallowtail population in the Keys. However, the speciesâ€™ recovery is still hindered by insecticide use, habitat destruction, droughts, hurricanes and illegal collection
