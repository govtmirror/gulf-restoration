# Our Responsibilities

## Trust Resources in General

When the Service uses the term "trust resources," we are talking about the Service's responsibilities as defined by legislation, a treaty or some similar authority. The responsibility for the conservation of fish and wildlife is a shared responsibility, and the degree to which the Service is involved will varies with species and situations.

Congress has charged the Secretary of the Interior with responsibilities for the management of certain fish and wildlife resources, e.g., endangered and threatened species, migratory birds, certain marine mammals, and certain aspects of the management of some fish. Even in these specific instances, with the limited exception of marine mammals, State jurisdiction remains concurrent with Federal authority. In general, the States possess broad trustee and police powers over fish and wildlife within their borders. The Service shares responsibility for many fish and wildlife resources with other entities working in the context of multiple jurisdictions.

In addition, the Service is responsible for administering a national network of lands and waters for the conservation, management, and where appropriate, restoration of the fish, wildlife, and plant resources and their habitats within the United States for the benefit of present and future generations of Americans.  This National Refuge System has grown to include more than 560 refuges, 38 wetland management districts and other protected areas encompassing 150 million acres of land and water from the Caribbean to the remote Pacific. There is at least one national wildlife refuge in every state and territory and within an hourâ€™s drive of most major metropolitan areas.
