As the federal fish and wildlife agency, the Service has a responsibility to the public, including our partners, to ensure meaningful conservation outcomes for our shared fish and wildlife goals. It is essential that we not only engage with partners, but also support and bridge our common efforts. While the conservation needs of the Gulf of Mexico are daunting, collectively we have the potential to significantly advance Gulf restoration and provide ecological and economic benefits to the American public.

Close relationships with the state fish and wildlife agencies, other federal agencies, regional and local governments, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), private landowners, industries and other partners across the Gulf of Mexico watershed are central to the Service's Vision. Ultimately, the level of success we reach in restoring the waters of the Gulf of Mexico will be directly related to how well we coordinate our efforts. If we choose to work independently, we will miss the opportunity to accomplish something greater than any of us could achieve alone.

The mission of the U.S. Department of the Interior's NRDA Restoration Program is to restore natural resources injured as a result of oil spills or hazardous substance releases into the environment. In partnership with affected state, tribal and federal trustee agencies, the NRDA Restoration Program conducts damage assessments which are the first step toward resource restoration and used to provide the basis for determining restoration needs that address the public's loss and use of natural resources.

Once the damages are assessed, the NRDA Restoration Program negotiates legal settlements or takes other legal actions against the responsible parties for the spill or release. Funds from these settlements are then used to restore the injured resources at no expense to the taxpayer. Settlements often include the recovery of the costs incurred in assessing the damages. These funds may also be used to fund damage assessments in future incidents. All actions taken by the NRDA Restoration Program on behalf of citizens of the United States are done with the goal of restoring injured natural resources.

## [The Gulf Restoration Council](http://www.restorethegulf.gov/)

In July 2012, in response to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and other environmental challenges in the Gulf Coast region, Congress passed the Resources and Ecosystems Sustainability, Tourist Opportunities, and Revived Economies of the Gulf Coast States Act ([RESTORE Act](http://www.restorethegulf.gov/sites/default/files/RESTORE%20ACT%20July2012.pdf)). The RESTORE Act created a Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund and established the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council (Council).

The Council is comprised of governors from the five Gulf States affected by the Deepwater Horizon spill; the Secretaries from the U.S. Departments of the Interior, Commerce, Agriculture, and Homeland Security as well as the Secretary of the Army; and the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. One of the Council's primary responsibilities is to develop a Comprehensive Plan to restore the ecosystem and economy of the Gulf Coast region.

The RESTORE ACT dedicates 80 percent of all administrative and civil penalties related to the Deepwater Horizon spill to the Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund and outlines a structure by which the funds can be utilized to restore and protect the natural resources, ecosystems, fisheries, marine and wildlife habitats, beaches, coastal wetlands, and economy of the Gulf Coast region. The Council has oversight responsibility for 60% of the Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund.
