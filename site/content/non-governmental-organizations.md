# Non-Governmental Organizations

The Service's Gulf Restoration Program's mission is to guide collaborative conservation planning and delivery for large-scale Gulf restoration. Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) are key collaborators in the Service's effort to achieve the greatest and most immediate benefit to the public's fish and wildlife resources in the Gulf of Mexico watershed.

Some major NGOs involved in Gulf Coast restoration are:

## [National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF): Gulf Environmental Benefit Fund](http://www.nfwf.org/gulf/Pages/home.aspx)

In early 2013, a U.S. District Court approved two plea agreements resolving the criminal cases against BP and Transocean, which arose from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill.Â Under the terms of the agreements, NFWF's Gulf Environmental Benefit Fund will receive more than $2.5 billion over a five-year period to "remedy harm and eliminate or reduce the risk of future harm to Gulf Coast natural resources."

## [Gulf Coast Alliance](http://www.gulfofmexicoalliance.org/)

The Gulf of Mexico Alliance is a broad partner network led by the five Gulf states that includes other nonprofits, federal agencies, academic organizations, and businesses in the region. The alliance's goal is to significantly increase regional collaboration to enhance the environmental and economic health of the Gulf of Mexico.

As a reflection of the depth and breadth of the interests of its membership, the GOMA website includes access to resources ranging from a [Deepwater Horizon Project Tracker](http://www.dwhprojecttracker.org/) to track restoration/research/recovery projects resulting from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill; to a [metadata catalog and data repository](http://gomaportal.org/geoportal/catalog/main/home.page) for Gulf of Mexico related geospatial datasets; to natural hazards [handbooks](http://stormsmart.org/handbook/) for homeowners in each of the five Gulf States.
