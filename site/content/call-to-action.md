The Service mission is clear on this point: ***Work with others*** *to conserve, protect and enhance fish, wildlife and plants and their habitats for the continuing benefit of the American people*. Nowhere is a partnership-driven approach more central in fulfilling this mission than in the Gulf of Mexico watershed.

In 2013, the Service released "Vision for a Healthy Gulf of Mexico Watershed" in order to articulate to partners and other stakeholders how to most effectively address the damage not only from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster, but also the loss of natural resources over the previous decades. This document sets the stage for a restoration approach that considers not only the Gulf Coast, but also the entire watershed that feeds the Gulf of Mexico. The Service's "Vision for a Healthy Gulf of Mexico Watershed":

1. articulates overarching restoration and conservation strategies for sustaining fish and wildlife resources and thriving communities for future generations;
2. identifies geographically based high-priority focal areas and conservation strategies to help align the efforts of the Service with its partners and other stakeholders around far-reaching and sustainable goals.

The Service's "[Vision for a Healthy Gulf of Mexico Watershed](http://www.fws.gov/gulfrestoration/pdf/VisionDocument.pdf)" (full document, PDF, 7.8 MB; [overview document](http://www.fws.gov/gulfrestoration/pdf/one-pagevisiondocument.pdf), PDF, 1.8 MB) identifies eight conservation strategies (the how we want to work with our partners) and 16 conservation focal areas (the where we want to work with our partners).

The Service identified the need for a greater level of specificity in guiding Gulf-wide restoration than is in the first document. With this in mind, the Service released "Next Steps for a Healthy Gulf of Mexico Watershed" in 2016. The Service's "Next Steps for a Healthy Gulf of Mexico Watershed":

1. highlights specific courses of action for the development and implementation of conservation and restoration initiatives in each of the geographic focal areas included in "Vision for a Healthy Gulf of Mexico Watershed";
2. reiterates our belief that a long-term, large-scale, watershed-level approach to restoration and conservation is important if we are to achieve a healthy Gulf.

The Service's "Next Steps for a Healthy Gulf of Mexico Watershed" grows out of themes and action items raised in the earlier document; it includes refinements and additions, such as two new focal areas in Florida.
