# Our Role

The Service is uniquely positioned to be a strong partner in the restoration of the Gulf of Mexico and its watershed. Our mission &mdash; to conserve, protect and enhance fish, wildlife, plants and their habitats for the continuing benefit of the American people &mdash; compels us to address the Gulf of Mexico's many challenges. We are also obligated to do so as the steward of America's national wildlife refuges; as the lead federal agency for the protection of migratory birds and anadromous fish (i.e. fish that divide their lives between freshwater and the ocean); and as the co-lead for the recovery of federally threatened and endangered species, including marine mammals.

The Service is in charge of 233 National Wildlife Refuges (NWR) in the Gulf of Mexico watershed that serve as the backbone for a network of conservation lands dedicated to supporting fish and wildlife populations and providing unparalleled outdoor experiences for all Americans. Our refuge stewardship responsibilities began in the Gulf States in 1903 with the establishment of Pelican Island NWR, and on the Gulf Coast itself in 1904 with that of Breton Island NWR.

Additionally, the Service has field and regional representation in all 31 states in the Gulf of Mexico watershed, which stretches across five Service administrative regions (i.e., Southeast, Southwest, Midwest, Mountain- Prairie and Northeast). Throughout the watershed, the Service provides a combination of conservation planning and on-the-ground contributions through our various programs focusing on such matters as wildlife and sportfish restoration grants, refuge management, endangered species recovery work, fish and aquatic conservation, migratory birds and law enforcement activities.

The Service understands that conserving habitat and maintaining functioning landscapes not only benefits fish and wildlife, but also benefits our society in the form of ecosystem services that support healthy and resilient communities and economies. The Service works with the states and others to proactively conserve hundreds of species in the Gulf region in the hopes that they will not require federal protection.
