# U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Gulf Restoration Program (GRP)

The GRP is a multi-disciplinary team of U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service professionals who are working together to develop the Service's capacity to strategically connect with programs and partners throughout the Gulf of Mexico and its watershed. The team's mission is to collaborate in leveraging Gulf restoration efforts to maximize conservation outcomes.

## GRP Elements

<p>The team is comprised of staff in in programs across the Service's five geographic regions that encompass the Gulf of Mexico watershed: Southeast; Southwest; Midwest; Northeast and Mountain-Prairie. While members are physically located in offices as far apart as Rock Island, Illinois, and Panama City, Florida, the team is not focused geographically but is organized into five functional areas:</p>

- Habitat Conservation
- Restoration
- Science
- Environmental Compliance
- Communications

The GRP involves support from Service staff such as environmental compliance experts, restoration biologists, geographic information system (GIS) analysts, administrative officers, database managers, realty assistants and communication specialists.

## The Origin of the GRP

The Gulf of Mexico is critically important to the health and vitality of our nation's economic and natural resources. The Gulf and its Coast, from Texas to Florida, is home to more than 130 federally protected species, most of which are endangered.

The explosion of the Deepwater Horizon rig here on April 20, 2010, set into motion one of the largest environmental disasters in our nation's history. The Service, recognizing both the severity of the spill as well as the long-standing ecological challenges facing the region, established the GRP in February 2014. The team is focused on the recovery of the region from this 2010 disaster, as well as broader ecosystem challenges brought on by storms, development pressures and other stressors.

In the aftermath of the DWH oil spill, a number of new restoration initiatives began. Each has the potential to direct billions of dollars into restoration projects.

## The Work of the GRP

The core goal of the GRP is to create a unified, strategic approach to Gulf restoration.The initial approach rests on a long-term restoration plan released by the Service in July 2013 entitled U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's "Vision for a Healthy Gulf of Mexico Watershed."

The GRP is engaging all Service programs across the Gulf region to implement the Service's "Vision," which offers a "big picture" view of a science-based, watershed-wide approach to restoring the region's resources. The team is also preparing a follow-up document that will:

- Clearly articulate how the Service will execute its commitment to work with and support others to further Gulf of Mexico restoration;
- Establish standards that will guide the Service in pursuing effective conservation actions;
- Highlight examples of on-the-ground efforts that the Service believes are successful models of Gulf conservation strategies.
