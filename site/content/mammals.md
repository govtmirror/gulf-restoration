# Mammals

The Service is responsible, along with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, for implementing provisions of the Federal Endangered Species Act.  This means the Service manages the conservation of mammal species that are threatened or endangered in the Gulf region, as well as the conservation of the habitat upon which these creatures depend.

Mammal species found in the Gulf of Mexico region over which the Service has jurisdiction include:

## Alabama Beach Mouse

The [Alabama beach mouse](http://www.fws.gov/daphne/es/abm/ABM_Index.html) (*Peromyscus polionotus ammobates*) is one of several subspecies of old field mice which live only in coastal sand dune areas. These beach mice in general are about 4-5 inches long, including their tail, and weigh around 12.5 grams (less than the weight of three nickels).

There are many threats facing the Alabama beach mouse: coastal development, hurricanes and tropical storms have fragmented and destroyed its habitat, with dune use by pedestrians degrading it further. Stalking by domestic and feral cats (as well as other animals), exotic vegetation, and competition from other rodents have also contributed to Alabama beach mouse population declines. It was listed for federal protection as an endangered species in 1985.

## West Indian Manatee

The [West Indian manatee](http://www.fws.gov/southeast/wildlife/mammal/manatee/) (*Trichechus manatus*) is a large, elongated marine mammal with paired flippers and a large, spoon-shaped tail. West Indian manatees can reach lengths of over 14 feet and weights of over 3,000 pounds. Due to their size and diet of seagrasses and other aquatic plants, people often call these animals "sea cows."

Historically, West Indian manatees were found along the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts, throughout the Caribbean, and as far south as Brazilâ€™s Atlantic coastline. However, due to many factors such as hunting, habitat fragmentation and loss, these manatees have disappeared from various parts of their range. During the summer, manatees on rare occasions are seen as far north as Rhode Island on the Atlantic coast, and as far west as Texas on the Gulf coast. A subspecies known as the Florida manatee (*Trichechus manatus latirostris*) can be found throughout Florida for most of the year.

Manatees are protected under the Endangered Species Act and under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. On January 8, 2016, the Service proposed to reclassify the manatee from endangered to threatened under the Endangered Species Act. Protections for the manatee would not change if reclassified.

## Key Deer

The [Key deer](http://www.fws.gov/verobeach/MSRPPDFs/KeyDeer.pdf) (*Odocoileus virginianus clavium*) is a subspecies of the Virginia white-tailed deer. They are the smallest of all white-tailed deer: the shoulder height of Key deer is between 24-32 inches; does weigh 45 to 65 pounds, while bucks weigh 55 to 80 pounds. They are found nowhere else in the world but in the Florida Keys.

By the late 1940s, over-hunting and killing by Keys residents and visitors had nearly driven the Key deer to extinction. By the early 1950s, only 25 deer remained. The Key deer was designated as federally endangered on March 11, 1967.

## Florida Panther

The Florida panther (*Puma concolor coryi*) is the last subspecies of *Puma concolor* (also known as mountain lion, cougar, or puma) still surviving in the eastern United States. Mature male panthers examined in the wild in Florida since 1978 have weighed from 102 to 160 pounds and measured nearly seven-feet from nose to the tip of the tail. Females were considerably smaller, with a weight range of 50 to 115 pounds and measuring about six feet.

Historically occurring throughout the southeastern United States, today the panther is restricted to less than five percent of its historic range in a single breeding population in southern Florida. In 1967, the U.S. Department of the Interior listed the Florida panther as an endangered subspecies.
