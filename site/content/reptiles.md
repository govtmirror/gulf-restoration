# Reptiles

The Service is responsible, along with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, for implementing provisions of the Federal Endangered Species Act.  This means the Service manages the conservation of reptile species that are threatened or endangered in the Gulf region, as well as the conservation of the habitat upon which these species depend.

Reptile species found in the Gulf of Mexico region over which the Service has jurisdiction include:

## American Crocodile

The [American crocodile](http://myfwc.com/media/152527/LivingwithCrocodiles.pdf) (*Crocodylus acutus*) has a tapered snout and is grayish-green in color. When its mouth is closed, the fourth tooth on the lower jaw is exposed. American crocodiles have been known to reach lengths of 20 feet, though they are typically smaller in the United States.

The American crocodile historically occurred throughout mangrove and estuarine areas of South Florida including the Florida Keys; worldwide, the species is found throughout the Caribbean Sea, as well as along the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of Central and South America. The American crocodile is federally listed as a threatened species after being downlisted from endangered in 2007.

## Kemp’s Ridley Sea Turtle

The [Kemp’s ridley](http://www.fws.gov/kempsridley/kempsfactsheet.html) (*Lepidochelys kempii*) is one of the smallest of the sea turtles, with adults reaching about 2 feet in length and weighing up to about 100 pounds. The adult turtle has an oval carapace that is almost as wide as it is long and is usually olive-gray in color.

Outside of nesting, the major habitat for Kemp's ridley sea turtles is the nearshore and inshore waters of the northern Gulf of Mexico. The Kemp’s ridley is the most endangered of the sea turtles, and was federally listed in 1970. The decline of this species is primarily due to human activities, including the direct harvest of adults and eggs and incidental capture in commercial fishing operations.

## Leatherback Sea Turtle

The [leatherback](http://www.fws.gov/northflorida/seaturtles/turtle%20factsheets/PDF/Leatherback-Sea-Turtle.pdf) (*Dermochelys coriacea*) is the largest, deepest diving, and most migratory and wide-ranging of all sea turtles. The adult leatherback sea turtle can reach 4 to 8 feet in length and 500 to 2000 pounds in weight. It is unique among sea turtles because instead of a bony carapace, its shell is composed of a mosaic of small bones covered by rubbery or leather-like outer skin. This skin is predominantly black with varying degrees of pale spotting.

The leatherback turtle is distributed worldwide in tropical and temperate waters of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. It is also found in small numbers as far north as British Columbia, Newfoundland, and the British Isles, and as far south as Australia, Cape of Good Hope, and Argentina. Sea turtles, in general, are susceptible to human changes to the marine environment, as well as to their nesting beaches. The leatherback sea turtle was listed as endangered in 1970.
