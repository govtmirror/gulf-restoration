On April 20, 2010, the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded 41 miles off the coast of Louisiana.  Eleven people lost their lives in the explosion, and life along the coast changed dramatically.  As oil from the damaged well began flowing into the Gulf of Mexico, Service biologists were on high alert.  The Gulf Coast region is a globally unique ecosystem that supports a high number of beach-nesting birds, such as sandwich terns, brown pelicans and Wilson’s plovers.  At the time of the spill, these species were on the verge of nesting season, and oil would be detrimental to the birds.  Nesting sea turtles were also in grave danger, and the embattled species was at risk of losing an entire nesting season.

While oil was still far from land, contaminants biologist Jon Hemming in the Service’s Panama City Field Office was already in response mode.  He was in contact with another Service contaminants biologist, Pete Tuttle, who was stationed in Daphne, Alabama.  Together, the two acted as first responders to the region.  “We immediately began to coordinate, discussing the needs in Alabama and the Florida panhandle,” says Hemming.

Biologists only had days to figure out how to protect wildlife and minimize exposure to oil.  This meant quickly organizing teams, deploying boats and helicopters, and forming strategies on how to protect sensitive lands.  “Every day, we had to watch the projections, and match those with the proper ground response.  This took coordination from the Department of Interior, Region 4 of the Service, refuges and field offices,” explains Hemming.  “From former Secretary Salazar to biologists in the Atlanta Regional Office and project leaders in the field, we all had to work together.”

Don Imm was the Panama City Field Office Project Leader at that time.  He quickly realized this disaster was happening in his own backyard and would occupy most of his staff.  “From recovery operations, to the administrative aspect, GIS [geographic information system], and the Natural Resources Damage Assessment and Recovery process, my staff was dedicated to assisting with the spill,” says Imm, now the supervisor of [Georgia Ecological Services Field Office](http://www.fws.gov/athens/).

Imm also joined staff members as part of the wildlife operations recovery team.  Members  spent endless hours in the heat, looking for oiled wildlife.  When calls came into the wildlife hotline, these folks were on stand-by, ready to take action.  Laura Jenkins, who is now retired, served on the recovery team and says it gave local folks a sense of comfort, knowing Service biologists were scouring the beaches.  “The people we talked to were grateful and happy,” explains Jenkins.  “They were especially relieved that we were also working on the weekends.”

Not that the work was easy.  Biologists walked miles of beach, working 12- to 17-hour days.  “There were hot days, some over 100 degrees.  We drank water throughout the day to stay hydrated,” says Jenkins.

Besides saving wildlife, one of the most rewarding things was meeting people from all over the country, who came to northwest Florida to lend a hand.  “From Alaska, to Washington … even North Dakota, it was neat meeting the dedicated workers.  Service firefighters also committed their time to the oil spill,” says Jenkins.

Teams of biologists also kicked off the Natural Resources Damage and Assessment (NRDA) process and had the tough task of measuring the oil's damage to wildlife. Biologist Mary Mittiga was on the NRDA bird survey group.

"The worst thing during the spill response was that period when the oil was still gushing out, being out there every day witnessing the disaster, and not knowing what the future held for the Gulf Coast.  It was a threat to both our livelihood, the natural resources that we're entrusted with protecting and our home," says Mittiga.

In the end, the Service’s Panama City biologists had reason to be thankful.  Their pristine beaches received minimal oiling.  But Panama City biologists aren’t quite ready to let their guards down.   "Even though the Florida coast was not as heavily oiled, we still do not fully understand the full effects of the damage to the Gulf, says current Project Leader Catherine Phillips.  "Our work will not stop until we see a full recovery from the oil spill of 2010.”
