title: Proposed BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill settlement largest in U.S. history

On October 5, U.S Attorney General Loretta Lynch, announced a “major step forward in our effort to deliver justice to the Gulf region.” Flanked by four Cabinet level leaders, Lynch explained, “We have secured an historic resolution of our pending claims against BP, totaling more than $20 billion and making it the largest settlement against any entity in American history.” BP was the party primarily responsible for 2010’s Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the largest environmental disaster in U.S. history.

If approved by a federal judge, Lynch said the settlement agreement would end a long and arduous legal journey that brought the U.S. Department of Justice together with five Gulf states and four federal agencies to make BP pay penalties for Clean Water Act violations and damages for injuries to natural resources. While a “major step forward,” Lynch said much work remains. The 350-page written agreement known as the consent decree is a proposed agreement; it will be finalized only after Justice considers all public comments received before the December 4 deadline.

## $5.5 billion provided for RESTORE Act projects

The $20 billion total agreed to by BP includes a $5.5 billion penalty under the Clean Water Act. In accordance with the RESTORE Act of 2012, which set up a framework for restoring the ecosystem and economy of the Gulf Coast region, 80 percent of these funds will go to environmental restoration, economic recovery projects, and tourism and seafood promotion in Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas.
