# Fish

The Service is responsible, along with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, for implementing provisions of the Federal Endangered Species Act (ESA). This means the Service manages the conservation of fish species that are threatened or endangered in the Gulf region, as well as the conservation of the habitat upon which they depend.  The Service is also responsible for the conservation of “interjurisdictional” and “anadromous” fish that may not be under the protection of the ESA.

“Interjurisdictional” fish generally means a fish population that crosses state or international boundaries. Falling into the interjurisdictional category are coastal and marine species such as red drum, spotted sea trout, red snapper, and a multitude of others.

The term “anadromous” refers to a species that spawns in rivers but spends part of its life in the ocean. Dams that have been built on many southeastern rivers are thought to be a major reason for the decline of anadromous fish species in the Gulf of Mexico.

Fish species found in the Gulf of Mexico region over which the Service has jurisdiction include:

## Gulf Striped bass

The Gulf Striped bass (*Morone saxatilis*) has an elongated body that dorsally ranges in color from light green to olive, or steel blue, to brown or black. Laterally, this fish is silver with seven or eight dark continuous stripes running longitudinally. The Gulf striped bass is a popular game fish and is valued by sport and commercial fishermen alike.

The Gulf striped bass was native to Gulf of Mexico rivers from the Suwannee River in Florida to at least the rivers draining into Lake Pontchartrain in eastern Louisiana and southwestern Mississippi. Striped bass populations began declining earlier this century, and by the mid-1960s had disappeared from all Gulf rivers except for the Apalachicola River system of Alabama, Florida and Georgia.

## Gulf sturgeon

The Gulf sturgeon (*Acipenser oxyrinchus desotoi*) traces its ancestry back 200 million years &mdash; and its appearance hasn’t changed much in all this time. Its snout is greatly extended and bladelike, and it is well armored with rows of heavy plates. The Gulf sturgeon is light brown to dark brown in color. This fish reaches lengths of up to nine feet and can weigh up to 300 pounds.

The Gulf sturgeon was listed as threatened in 1991. Recreational and commercial fishing is prohibited by the states of Florida, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana.

## Pallid sturgeon

The pallid sturgeon (*Scaphirhynchus albus*) has a prehistoric look, with a flattened snout, long slender tail and five lengthwise rows of bony plates instead of scales. The back and sides of pallid sturgeons are grayish-white. This fish reaches lengths of 6 feet and can weigh up to 80 pounds.

The pallid sturgeon experienced a dramatic decline throughout its range and was listed as endangered in 1990.

## Hypoxia

Many of migratory fish (and other wildlife) use both the Gulf and inland aquatic habitats during various parts of their lifecycle, so healthy habitats in both places are necessary for healthy populations.

Scientific investigations in the Gulf of Mexico have documented a large area of the Texas-Louisiana continental shelf with seasonally depleted oxygen levels (< 2mg/l). Most aquatic species cannot survive at such low oxygen levels. This oxygen depletion, referred to as **hypoxia**, begins in late spring, reaches a maximum in midsummer, and disappears in the fall. The hypoxic zone covers a five-year running average of 5,454 square miles in the northern Gulf; it forms in the middle of the most important commercial and recreational fisheries in the coterminous United States and could threaten the economy of this region of the Gulf.
Conservation actions such as reforestation, restoring riparian areas, reducing nutrient input to streams, implementing best management practices for agriculture and forestry, and stormwater protection can reduce nutrient input into streams.
