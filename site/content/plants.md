# Plants and Lichens

The Service is responsible, along with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, for implementing provisions of the Federal Endangered Species Act.  This means the Service manages the conservation of plant and lichen species that are threatened or endangered in the Gulf region, as well as the conservation of the habitat upon which these species depend.

Plant and lichen species found in the Gulf of Mexico region over which the Service has jurisdiction include:

## Beautiful Pawpaw

The [beautiful pawpaw](http://www.fws.gov/verobeach/msrppdfs/beautiful.pdf) (*Deeringothamnus pulchellus*) is a low, deciduous shrub 8 - 12 inches tall. Its common names include “royal false pawpaw,” and “white squirrel banana.” The beautiful pawpaw is threatened with extinction because of habitat loss due to agricultural, residential, and commercial conversion of land. The exclusion of fire is also responsible for habitat degradation throughout much of the species’ range, which is in disjunct locations in central and southwest Florida. It was federally listed as an endangered species in 1986.

## Garber’s Spurge

The [Garber’s spurge](https://www.fws.gov/verobeach/MSRPPDFs/Garbers.PDF) (*Chamaesyce garberi*) is a short-lived, perennial herb with fuzzy-haired branches that can be upright or sprawl across the ground. The Garber’s spurge is endemic to South Florida; it is abundant on Cape Sable and is probably found throughout the Keys in small numbers. It was listed in 1985 due to habitat loss from increased residential and commercial development.

The [Key tree cactus](https://www.fws.gov/verobeach/MSRPPDFs/KeyCactus.PDF) (*Pilosocereus robinii*) is the largest of the native Florida cactii and can reach 30 feet in height. The Key tree cactus is found in the United States only in the Florida Keys, and was federally listed as endangered in 1984 because of severe population declines caused by destruction of upland areas in the Keys for commercial and residential development activities.

[Floridap perforate cladonia](http://www.fws.gov/verobeach/msrppdfs/flperforate.pdf) (*Cladonia perforata*) is a member of the reindeer lichens family. Lichens are a complex life form that is a symbiotic partnership of two separate types of organisms, a fungus and an alga; the dominant partner is the fungus, which gives the lichen the majority of its characteristics.

The Florida perforate cladonia is relatively large, with the visible part of the lichen (the fruiting body) being yellow-gray, slightly glossy and measuring up to 2.4 in in length. The fruiting body is a branching, tufted structure; the branches are perforated with tiny holes.

This lichen can only be found in high, well-drained sands of  rosemary scrub in Florida. Cladonia perforata was listed as endangered in 1993 because this particular scrub habitat is increasingly rare and patchy due to habitat destruction and degradation.
