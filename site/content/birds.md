# Birds

The Service is responsible, along with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, for implementing provisions of the Federal Endangered Species Act.  This means the Service manages the conservation of bird species that are threatened or endangered in the Gulf region, as well as the conservation of the habitat upon which they depend.

Bird species found in the Gulf of Mexico region over which the Service has jurisdiction include:

## Piping Plover

The piping plover (*Charadrius melodus*) is a small shorebird approximately seven inches long with sand-colored plumage on its back and crown and white underparts. It breeds only in North America in three geographic regions: the Atlantic Coast, the Northern Great Plains, and the Great Lakes. All three breeding populations winter along the Gulf Coast, as well as on South Atlantic and Caribbean beaches and barrier islands.

Piping plover populations were federally listed as threatened and endangered in 1986. The Northern Great Plains and Atlantic Coast populations are threatened, and the Great Lakes population is endangered. Piping plovers are considered threatened throughout their wintering range.

## Wood stork

The wood stork (*Mycteria Americana*) is a large, white, bald-headed wading bird of the southeastern swamps. It is the only stork breeding in the United States, and it captures its prey by a specialized technique known as grope-feeding or tacto-location. Feeding often occurs in water 6 to 10 inches deep, where a stork probes with its bill partly open. When a fish touches the bill, it quickly snaps shut. The average response time of this reflex is 25 milliseconds, making it one of the fastest reflexes known in vertebrates.

When wood storks were listed as federally endangered in 1984, their population was dropping a precipitous 5 percent a year. Since then, a highly successful conservation and recovery effort has resulted in the species’ status being changed from “endangered” to “threatened” in 2014.

## Mississippi Sandhill Crane

The Mississippi sandhill crane (*Grus canadensis pulla*) looks somewhat like a great blue heron. The dark blue-grey color of the Mississippi sandhill crane's plumage is similar in color to the plumage of a great blue heron, and both birds are tall and thin, with long legs, necks and beaks. Despite their appearance, though, the cranes are not closely related to herons, and their biology and way of living is quite different.

Mississippi sandhill cranes were listed as federally endangered in 1973; they’re found in the wild nowhere else but on, and adjacent to, the Mississippi Sandhill Crane National Wildlife Refuge. The original range of this population, however, is believed to have extended along the Gulf coastal plain from southern Louisiana east into Mississippi, Alabama, and into the western Florida panhandle. Much of the loss of crane habitat is due to the conversion of open pine savanna to pine plantations created following World War II.

## Whooping Crane

The whooping crane (*Grus Americana*) is found only in North America, and is the continent’s tallest bird, with males approaching 5 feet when standing erect. These cranes are almost entirely white; their most noticeable characteristic is a large red patch on the head that is made of skin and is almost featherless.

Whooping cranes currently exist in the wild at 3 locations and in captivity at 12 sites. The bird was listed as federally endangered in 1967, and non-experimental populations retain this status.
